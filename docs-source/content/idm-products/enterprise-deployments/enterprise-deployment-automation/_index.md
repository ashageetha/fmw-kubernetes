### Enterprise Deployment Automation


The [Enterprise Deployment Automation scripts](https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes/tree/master/FMWKubernetesMAA/OracleEnterpriseDeploymentAutomation/OracleIdentityManagement), allow you to automatically deploy the entire Oracle Identity and Access Management suite in a production environment.

For more information about the use of these scripts, see [Automating the Identity and Access Management Enterprise Deployment](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/12.2.1.4/ikedg/automating-identity-management-deployment.html).
